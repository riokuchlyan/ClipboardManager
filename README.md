# clipboardManager

I created this clipboard manager as unlike windows, MacOs does not have a dedicated clipboard manager. 

This program, which works on all operating systems, reads and writes to the clipboard using the subprocess library. The graphical user interface is then created using Tkinter.

The textbox at the bottom lets users select what text from their clipboard history to copy.
